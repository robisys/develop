Instead, we need to download an older version of the compiler from the internet and use that to build a new version of the compiler from the source tree.\r\nstage0 downloads an older version of the compiler from the internet.\r\n  * stage1    \r\nOnce we have a version of the compiler downloaded, we start to compile a new version from source. We use the compiler from stage0 to build the stage1 compiler.\r\nThe stage1 compiler contains all new language features & optimizations, but are not used in the compiler itself. To build the compiler with these new features & optimizations, we need to build from source again using this version of the compiler.\r\n  * stage2  \r\nUsing the compiler from stage1 which contains all new language features & optimizations we build the stage2 compiler. At this point, we have the latest, most advanced & optimized version of the compiler.\r\nThe final (and optional) build step is to re-build the compiler once more using the compiler from stage2 to produce the stage3 compiler.\r\n  * stage3   \r\nThe stage3 compiler should be bitwise identical to the stage2 compiler. We build it to ensure that we haven't introduced any new issues in the latest build.\r\n\r\n* Cargo  \r\n  The Rust communityâ€™s crate host   \r\n[Cargo crates.io](https://crates.io/)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
